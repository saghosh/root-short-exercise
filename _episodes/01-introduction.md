Introduction to ROOT!

> ## What is ROOT?
> Most likely some of you were already in touch with ROOT! 
> ROOT is an open-source data analysis framework used by high energy physics and others, which lets you save and access your experiment's data, allows you to process the data in a computationally efficient and statistically sound way and gives you access to all tools to produce publication-quality results.
> Basically, ROOT allows you to prcess data for physics analyses.

> ## What can I learn here?
> We would like to show you how you can perform efficient data analysis with ROOT! Starting with getting access to ROOT without any hassle, you will learn the advantages of ROOT in C++ and Python.  Another ingredient for efficient analysis is a simple way to get help quickly and therefore you will learn where you can find support. ROOT can be used to go efficiently from the initial datasets to the result plots, all powered by ROOT!
